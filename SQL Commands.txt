First you will have to create a user called "bloatedalts" with the password "Pmjp8f8QXKZno7qL" without the quotes. (Make sure to check the box to create a database with the same name and grant all privleges)

Then in the newly created database these are the commands you will have to run through phpmyadmin. They are enclosed in ~~ so dont include the tildas.

~CREATE TABLE `bloatedalts`.`users` ( `id` MEDIUMINT(60) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , `username` VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL , `email` VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL , `password` VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB;~

Then get the ip of your sql server and replace the 192.168.1.3 in the varibles.php file 
It should work once this is done, if it dosn't feel free to hit me up
